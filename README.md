# A Lightweight Spiking Neural Network Accelerator

A spiking neural network accelerator in the SkyWater 130nm process using heterogenous time constants to model a variety of temporal dynamics. Input events can be streamed at a rate of up to 50 MEvents per second, and the accelerator can process them in a dense network with 128 hidden neurons at up to approximately 214 MHz.

<!-- This is a template project you can clone and use to take part in the multi project submission to the
Google/Efabless/Skywater shuttle. -->

<!-- The tools that will test and create the aggregated design are here: https://github.com/mattvenn/multi_project_tools -->
